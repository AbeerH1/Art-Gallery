            Three women are depicted hiding behind a giant rock in this artwork.
            Courage is the woman on the far left. She leans forward in a hurry,
            her gaze fixed on the battle. She has a dagger in her right hand,
            which she intends to use to defend herself. Courage uses her left
            arm to keep Despair, the woman on the far right, at bay. Despair
            closes her eyes and sits sadly. Her posture suggests that she is
            withdrawing from the ferocity of the battle that the other two women
            are watching. Anxiety lurks in the shadows between Courage and
            Despair. Anxiety's hand clutches her neck, as if trying to prevent
            her worry from leaving her slightly parted lips. She peers out from
            behind the rock, a worried expression on her face as she observes
            the battle.
