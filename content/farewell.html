            Two females in a dimly lit area are depicted in this artwork.
            Background shadows almost entirely conceal the woman on the left,
            while the woman on the right is fully illuminated. The woman on the
            left is dressed in a light-colored gown, while the woman on the
            right is dressed in a darker gown. The two women appear to be
            holding each other's hands at the exact moment they are about to let
            go. They are not facing each other but instead are turned away from
            each other, their heads bowed in sorrow. The snake, for example, is
            a symbol of material temptation, to which the woman in dark dress
            has succumbed. Traditional characteristics such as compassion and
            self-sacrifice are represented by the woman in white, who has done
            her hardest to convince the other woman to value these virtues. The
            woman in the dark dress, on the other hand, has been enticed by the
            snake in the back, and instead of rejecting the material possessions
            she says goodbye to the woman in white—to virtue—and chooses
            material possessions.
