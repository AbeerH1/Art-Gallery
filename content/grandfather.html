            Anker was interested in everyday activities from regular life. His
            painting conveys a message of service and respect between
            generations to viewers. In this artwork, the grandfather's
            expression is wise and deep. While his wrinkled, workingman's hands
            have rested in reverent repose, his long-trained vision is fixed
            somewhere beyond. A mortal man's diminishing strength is tenderly
            bolstered by his pure-faced grandson's kind determination. The two
            figures exude a peaceful sense of calm. While the kid respectfully
            accepts a duty of service, the grandfather, despite his frailty,
            continues to lead and teach the kid in prayer.
