            This painting portrays the final moments of Ivan Jr., the only sane
            heir to the throne after he surrendered to death and accepted the
            fact that his death was at the hands of his father, Ivan the
            Terrible, who stands there terrified, holding his son's head in a
            futile attempt to stop the bloodshed.

                  Historians have found no evidence to explain why Evan Jr. was
                  murdered, but this artwork cemented in people's minds the
                  father's involvement in his son's death.
