            Through an open doorway, a dark, gloomy view of a bedroom is
            revealed. A wooden chair can be seen in the center, to the left of
            the open door, in what appears to be the hallway. Under the faded
            pink half-light coming through the horizontal slats of the blind
            that covers the window at the back of the room, a dressing table and
            chair are barely visible. The pieces of furniture are so blurry that
            it's possible that someone is sitting in the chair when there isn't
            anyone there. The bedroom at 6 Mornington Crescent is Sickert's
            personal quarters. His landlady had told Sickert that she suspected
            the former tenant of being the serial killer Jack the Ripper.

                  Walter Sickert, known for his dark portraits and dimly lit
                  domestic interiors, may have hid a dark secret for so long.
                  It's been said that disturbing artworks like "Jack the
                  Ripper's Bedroom" and "The Camden Town Murder" reveal a
                  relation between the artist and the vile Whitechapel butcher,
                  either as an accomplice or as the murderer personally.
