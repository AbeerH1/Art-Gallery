            The enormous depiction of the well-known prodigal son parable, an
            allegory of repentance and divine forgiveness, is represented in
            this dramatic painting. The artist emphasized the key elements of
            the story's climax: the penitent son being welcomed back with open
            arms by his forgiving father; the rich clothes and ring symbolizing
            the errant son's restoration to his former position in the family;
            and the fatted calf being led to the slaughter for the celebratory
            feast. Part of the charm of this artwork is in its human touches —
            the realism of the prodigal's dirty feet, the dog rushing up to
            welcome his master, and, perhaps most importantly, the ingenuous
            smile of the small kid leading the calf.
