            In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was the king of Ephyra (Corinth). Zeus
            was so irritated by Sisyphus' cunning and trickery that he sentenced
            him to an eternity of pushing a boulder uphill. The boulder would
            roll off as soon as he reached the top of the hill, and Sisyphus
            would have to push it back. Titian portrays Sisyphus trudging on a
            rough slope in his painting "Sisyphus." He does not push the rock to
            the top of the hill, but rather holds it on his shoulders and head,
            causing his shoulders and head to bow forward under the weight of
            the rock. This is a hellish atmosphere. Strange creatures inhabit
            the composition's lower-left corner, while fire and smoke fill the
            background. Sisyphus' feet appeared to be threatened by a serpent,
            as though the threat was pressuring him to hurry to the top of the
            hill.
