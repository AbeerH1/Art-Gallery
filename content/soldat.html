            Hans Larwin, an Austrian artist, painted Soldier and Death in 1917.
            It shows an Austro-Hungarian soldier aiming his rifle in a frontline
            trench with a skeletal comrade beside him. Death could be using the
            soldier in the trenches who already went through a lot as a tool to
            claim someone's life on the other side, death is steadying the
            soldier's aim and giving him the courage to fire. Looking at it
            another way, death may be coming for this soldier, his hand
            reassuringly on his back as he takes the rifle from the soldier
            whose time on Earth has come to an end. This painting emphasized the
            fact that death is always present among the soldiers.
