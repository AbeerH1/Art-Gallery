            A man stands with his back to the viewer, clothed in a dark green
            overcoat and gripping a walking stick in his right hand for balance,
            on an extremely steep rock face. As he gazes out over a landscape
            covered in a dense sea of fog, his hair is caught in the wind.
            Several more ridges, similar to the one the wanderer stands on, peek
            out of the mist in the middle of the composition. Mountains rise to
            the left in the distance, then level off into lowland plains in the
            east. The thick fog goes on eternally, blending in with the cloudy
            sky.

                  The landscape is based on the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in
                  Saxony and Bohemia. It is not an exact depiction of the
                  landscape, rather an amalgamation of various parts. Friedrich
                  would travel the mountains and create sketches. Then, back in
                  the studio, he would construct his own interpretation of the
                  landscape.
